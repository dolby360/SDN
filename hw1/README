About the program

ARP
Firstable there is the "arp" answer.
This functionality returns answer for every host that asks with a broadcast, details about the other host he searching.

For every packet that arrive in the switch, we asking if it is arp packet.
packet.find('arp')
Then by what the host asked, the switch returns a proper answer.

Routing
In this assignment we have been asked to route everything, according to the topology.
So you can see that in the connection up we enetered all the rules for every switch.
We divided the logic by sites. siteA siteB and the other two switches that act similar.

VideoSlice;
For that we just added these rules:
match.dl_type = 0x0800
match.nw_proto = 6
match.tp_dst=10000

And:

match.dl_type = 0x0800
match.nw_proto = 6
match.tp_dst=22
