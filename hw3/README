**Installation:**
sudo pip install networkx

**Settings:**
"ECMPBalancer.py" should be under "pox/ext/"
"runPox.sh" should be under "pox/"
"runTopology.sh" should be under "mininet/"
"randomTopology.py" should be under "mininet/"

**General explanations on the program:**
In the topology we use networkx for generating random topology.
Then we print the json file of the topology in the pox folder: "pox/ext" to let the controller read the file.
Then in the controller we read the file to hold the topology. That way we are able to be aware of the topology and calculate shortest path.

* I added a picture called "Graph and net.png" that shows the connection between the networkx and the actual topology.
You can see that hosts are painted in red and switches are painted in blue. And in the terminal you can see the for every edge in the graph there is edge in the topology.
